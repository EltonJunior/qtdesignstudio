# Hello_World

As every programmer knows no matter the programming language we start learning the first program SHALL be hello world.

I had a teacher that said, "it is a kind of a curse because if you don't make a hello world you never will learn this programming language".

Although QT Studio makes it very easy because as soon as the project is created, the Studio creates a Hello world with a button and control of the background and text.

We, as programmers MUST need to do our own program, so, I hope you agree with me.

Well! this program will be a simple hello world with only a text.

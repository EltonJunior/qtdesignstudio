# qtdesignstudio
This repo will contain some HMI created in QT Creator Studio as part of my learning in the Tool.

All project was created in QT Studio 3.9.0 based on Qt 6.4.0.

Those programs are based on the course from [KDAB Group Company](https://youtu.be/JxyTkXLbcV4) with Teacher Jesper Pedersen.

If you find something interesting here, or something that helps you, I really recommend you visit [KDAB Group Company](https://youtu.be/JxyTkXLbcV4) and check the content is very good, don't forget to leave a thumb up, they deserve it. 

Each lesson learned will have its own folder and inside it will have a README with a brief of the program made the picture and a gif if it has animation. 

the following list has all the content in this repo.

I'd love to leave here my shout-out to Peter from KDAB for the lessons help me a lot.
